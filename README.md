# Simple RNN for Sentiment Classification

This project demonstrates a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built with TensorFlow for sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The model is trained to detect negative reviews based on sequential text input.

## Features
- Built using TensorFlow's native RNN layers
- Focused on binary sentiment classification (negative vs. non-negative)
- Clean and minimal code structure for educational purposes
- Easily extendable to LSTM, GRU, or more advanced NLP architectures

## Dataset
IMDb movie reviews dataset â€” preprocessed for binary classification.  
This version focuses on identifying negative reviews.

## How to Run
